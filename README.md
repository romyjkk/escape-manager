# Repo to start practise on the technical aspect :)

It's my goal to create a unique problem reporting and inventory system for escaperooms, to help improve communication across the team and save a lot of time.

During the technical aspect of this project I'm receiving help and guidance from [Kevin](https://github.com/kevvie303), who's coincidentally my colleague and also created his own system for an escaperoom, which lead to him gathering a lot of knowledge in programming webapplications and Raspberry Pi's, using Python for the backend. Having never used Python before, I'm really glad he's almost as excited for my project as I am, and I'm very thankful for his help.

Some information about the technical aspect of this project:
* Backend will be written in Python.
* Frontend will be written in (vanilla) HTML, CSS and JS.
* Webpage will be hosted with Flask.
* Code will (eventually) be hosted on a Raspberry Pi.
* Data will be stored in JSON.

I'm very excited to see how this project will go, on this Github page I'll make sure to update as often as I can.
